# Here is the Challenge for yesterday and today:

# Create a Menu that has a list of items or services with prices.

# Display the menu for the user to see.

# Create an employee to ask which service the user would like.

# Ask if they would like anything else.

# Display the items they chose and the total cost.

# The client is now wanting a rating system for their customers.

# ask the customer for their name and a rating 1 - 5.

# store the information and display it from highest rating to lowest.

# display the average rating 

# Cap pizza, if pizza puts values, figure out to match the pizza and price

Pizza = {"Cheese" => "$5", "Pepperoni" => "$5", "Sausage" => "$7"}

 Price = Pizza.value
  puts "What kind of pizza would you like #{Pizza}?"
  answer = gets.chomp

  "The price of the #{answer} will be #{price}"
